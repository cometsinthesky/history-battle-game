## [Play History Battle Now!](https://cometsinthesky.github.io/biodiversity-battle-game/)

An interactive, classroom-friendly game to support **Biodiversity / Diversity of Living Things** learning - designed for **Middle Years / Year 6–9** contexts and adaptable to different curricula.

This project is ideal for teachers who want a quick, engaging way to reinforce:
- classification and taxonomy basics
- characteristics of living things
- ecosystems and interactions
- adaptations and survival
- scientific vocabulary and reasoning

## Learning Goals

Students will be able to:
- identify key characteristics of major groups of living things
- compare organisms using observable traits and evidence
- apply vocabulary (species, habitat, adaptation, producer/consumer, etc.)
- justify classification choices using scientific reasoning
- reflect on biodiversity and human impact

## Grouping Options
- **Pairs** (recommended): encourages discussion and peer explanation  
- **Stations**: rotate groups through the game + hands-on sorting cards  
- **Whole-class**: projector mode, teacher mediates decisions and prompts

## Classroom Rules (Simple & Clear)

To keep the activity productive:
1. **Materials on the table**: each group must have **one blank sheet of paper**, **a pencil**, and an **eraser** on the desk.
2. **Play to learn**: focus on reasoning, not just “getting points”.
3. **Explain your choices**: if you pick an answer, justify it with evidence.
4. **Respect turn-taking** (pairs/groups): one controls, the other explains; swap roles.
5. **No spoilers**: don’t shout answers to other groups - ask guiding questions instead.
6. **Use scientific vocabulary**: challenge yourself to use correct terms.
7. **Be kind & collaborative**: disagreements are part of science - discuss respectfully.

## Teacher Prompts (During Gameplay)

Use these to deepen thinking:
- “What evidence supports that classification?”
- “Which trait is the strongest indicator here?”
- “Could this organism fit in more than one group? Why?”
- “How might an adaptation help it survive in its habitat?”
- “What would happen if this species disappeared from the ecosystem?”

## Assessment Ideas

Quick and easy options:
- **Exit ticket**: “One new concept I learned + one question I still have.”
- **Mini-rubric** (0–2 points each): vocabulary, reasoning, collaboration, accuracy
- **Reflection**: “How does biodiversity support ecosystem stability?”

## Curriculum Connections

Works well with outcomes related to:
- classification of organisms
- ecosystems, habitats, and interactions
- adaptation and survival
- human impact on biodiversity
- scientific inquiry and communication
